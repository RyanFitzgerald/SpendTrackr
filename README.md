# SpendTrackr

SpendTrackr is a basic budgeting app that was built in React-Native (built primary for Android currently). This app was built in order to better familiarize myself with the React-Native workflow and environment.

## To-Do

- Add Statistics for spending over time
- Add ability to download a month to CSV to device
- Clean up code (D.R.Y, etc.)
